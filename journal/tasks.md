# Data Science Project Competition tasks

## April 2024
* Tasks after meeting 04.04
** Consider user study. 
Tips: Only two options. Many visualisations = big cognitive load. Ordering matters since more charts can give contex. SUPER SIMPLE!
** Look at top tabular counterfactual methods
** Read Nauta 2023. Eric will send it
** Read DiCe paper
** More or one counterfactuals. Show a 5 from our approach and 5 not our approach. Ask a few questions
** Define exactly what we expect to receive and what will we output/design API for our postprocessing wrapper
** Make backend

** When doing binning add an option to the UI to enable and disable it for the user study
** Make one hot encoding of categorical features and revert before returning the json with a counterfactual

* Meeting 26.04
** Add to backend check if model supports locking. Maybe only locking models
** Connect uploaded model to generator
** Think about how we are going to read the models and what types we are going to support
** Start with the UI
** Compare this without binning
** Compare without users (HOW???) A measure for how easy it will be for a user without a user
What method we want to use
Did they miss a method
If it doesn't exist can we create it
